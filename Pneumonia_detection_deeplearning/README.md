# **Pneumonia Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**

ðŸ©º **Deep Learning-Powered Pneumonia Detection from X-ray Images**

---

## **Overview**
This project leverages **Deep Learning** and **Image Processing** techniques to detect **Pneumonia** from chest X-ray images. Using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, the model classifies X-ray images into two categories: **Normal** and **Pneumonia**. This project aims to demonstrate the potential of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, providing a proof-of-concept for automated diagnosis.
